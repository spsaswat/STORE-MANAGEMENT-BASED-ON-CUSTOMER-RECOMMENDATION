# STORE MANAGEMENT BASED ON CUSTOMER RECOMMENDATION(Android and Desktop app)
We have created a store management system that is as efficient as possible. It would include functions from 3 perspectives:
-the consumer’s perspective: here we have an android application made in Android Studio that consumers can download on their phones and use to check product inventory and get corresponding bill amount
-the cashier’s perspective: here we have a Java Files + MySQL database where the cashier can generate the bill for consumer’s purchase with the stock being affected accordingly
-the manager’s perspective: Here we have the MySQL database, where the manager will be able to view inventory, modify it and also get a recommendation for adding new items in the proper amount
The entire software is coded in JAVA with a file-based database, MySQL and SQLite.
